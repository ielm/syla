# Syla Workspace Blackboard

## Current Status
- Platform architecture designed
- CLI specification complete
- Service architecture defined
- Workspace strategy documented

- **Meta-platform architecture implemented**
- **Parent workspace with Rust meta-CLI created**

## Key Decisions
- Polyrepo architecture with syla CLI orchestration
- Four workspace types: Ephemeral, Session, Persistent, Collaborative
- Firecracker microVMs for sandbox isolation
- gRPC for inter-service communication
- 18-week implementation timeline
- **Workspace-as-a-Platform approach adopted**
- **Rust chosen for all tooling**

## Next Steps
