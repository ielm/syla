### Next Steps
1. **✅ Move repositories to platform structure** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Moved syla-cli → platforms/syla/tools/cli/
   - ✅ Moved syla-api-gateway → platforms/syla/core/api-gateway/
   - ✅ Moved syla-execution-service → platforms/syla/core/execution-service/
   - ✅ repos.toml already had correct paths
2. **✅ Create parent repository** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Initialized git repo in workspace root
   - ✅ Added appropriate .gitignore
   - ✅ Pushed to GitHub as `ielm/syla`
3. **✅ Setup Developer Experience** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Moved meta-CLI to root `cli/` directory
   - ✅ Created `scripts/setup.sh` for one-line installation
