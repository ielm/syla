# Syla Workspace Blackboard

## Current Status
- Platform architecture designed
- CLI specification complete
- Service architecture defined
- Workspace strategy documented
- Implementation roadmap created
- **Meta-platform architecture implemented**
- **Parent workspace with Rust meta-CLI created**

## Key Decisions
- Polyrepo architecture with syla CLI orchestration
- Four workspace types: Ephemeral, Session, Persistent, Collaborative
- Firecracker microVMs for sandbox isolation
- gRPC for inter-service communication
- 18-week implementation timeline
- **Workspace-as-a-Platform approach adopted**
- **Rust chosen for all tooling**

## Next Steps
- [x] Set up repository structure
- [x] Begin Phase 1: Foundation implementation
- [x] Create service templates
- [x] Build CLI core functionality
- [x] Create meta-platform structure
- [ ] Move repositories to platform directories
- [ ] Complete meta-CLI dev commands
- [ ] Create parent git repository

## Recent Updates
- Created Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` for consistent development
- Legacy `.cursorrules` file also created for compatibility
- **MVP Implementation Started:**
  - Created syla-cli with basic structure
  - Implemented init, exec, version, doctor commands
  - Docker-based execution working (ready to test)
  - Configuration system implemented
- **Meta-Platform Created:**
  - Rust-based `syla` CLI for workspace management
  - Repository manifest system (`repos.toml`)
  - Platform directory structure
  - Updated CLAUDE.md for workspace guidance

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed ✅
- **Meta-Platform Architecture** - Workspace-as-a-Platform design
  - Parent workspace with `.platform/` tooling
  - Repository manifest system (`repos.toml`)
  - Hierarchical platform organization
  - Rust-based meta-CLI (`syla`)
- **Meta-CLI** - Workspace management tool
  - `init` - Clone repositories from manifest
  - `status` - Show repo and service status 
  - `doctor` - System health checks
  - `platform` - Platform operations (stub)
  - `dev` - Development environment (stub)
- **CLI** - Full implementation with API integration
  - `init` - Safe workspace initialization (won't overwrite)
  - `exec` - Supports both local Docker and remote API execution
  - `doctor` - System health check
  - `version` - Version info
  - API client for remote execution
- **API Gateway** - REST endpoints at port 8084
  - Health endpoint
  - Create/get execution endpoints
  - Forwards requests to Execution Service
  - In-memory cache for responses
- **Execution Service** - Worker queue at port 8083
  - Redis job queue (port 6380)
  - Docker executor with language support
  - Async worker processing
  - Full request/response flow
- **End-to-End Flow** - Fully functional
  - CLI → API Gateway → Execution Service → Docker
  - Python and JavaScript tested successfully
  - Sub-second execution times

### Next Steps
1. **✅ Move repositories to platform structure** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Moved syla-cli → platforms/syla/tools/cli/
   - ✅ Moved syla-api-gateway → platforms/syla/core/api-gateway/
   - ✅ Moved syla-execution-service → platforms/syla/core/execution-service/
   - ✅ repos.toml already had correct paths
2. **Complete meta-CLI implementation**
   - Implement `syla dev up` command
   - Add service log aggregation
   - Platform start/stop commands
3. **✅ Create parent repository** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Initialized git repo in workspace root
   - ✅ Added appropriate .gitignore
   - Push to GitHub as `datacurve/syla` (pending)
4. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive README
   - Add QUICKSTART guide for polyrepo
   - Document meta-CLI usage
5. **Future platforms**
   - Prepare for platforms/shipd/
   - Design shared/ components
   - Plan cross-platform integration

## Important Context
- Building code execution platform for DataCurve's Shipd product
- Inspired by Hermes but avoiding parent repo pattern
- Focus on sub-100ms cold starts
- Comprehensive telemetry for LLM training
