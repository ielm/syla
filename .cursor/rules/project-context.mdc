# Syla Platform Context

Building a code execution platform for DataCurve's Shipd product with:
- Sub-100ms cold starts using Firecracker microVMs
- Four workspace types: Ephemeral, Session, Persistent, Collaborative
- Polyrepo microservices architecture
- Rust-based services communicating via gRPC

Key services:
- `syla-cli` - Developer CLI tool
- `syla-api-gateway` - Entry point
- `syla-workspace-service` - Workspace management
- `syla-execution-service` - Code execution orchestration
- `syla-sandbox-runtime` - Secure execution environment

Current phase: Foundation (Weeks 1-3) - Setting up repos and CLI core.
