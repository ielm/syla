# CLI Development Patterns

Use `clap` with derive API:
```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "syla")]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Commands,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    Init { 
        #[arg(long)]
        name: Option<String> 
    },
    Exec {
        file: PathBuf,
        #[arg(long)]
        timeout: Option<Duration>,
    },
}
```

Output patterns:
- Human-readable by default
- Support `--json` for structured output
- Use indicatif for progress bars
- Clear error messages with suggestions

Always update `.eva/projects/syla-cli/blackboard.md` when adding commands.
