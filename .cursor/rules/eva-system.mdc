# Eva System Usage

Always use `.eva/` as persistent memory:
- Read `.eva/blackboard.md` at session start
- Update blackboard with progress and decisions
- Architecture docs in `.eva/docs/architecture/`
- Project-specific blackboards in `.eva/projects/<project>/blackboard.md`

When making changes:
1. Check blackboard for current context
2. Implement changes
3. Update blackboard with progress

Example workflow:
```bash
cat .eva/blackboard.md  # Check status
# ... work ...
edit .eva/blackboard.md # Update progress
```
