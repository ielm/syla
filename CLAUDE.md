# CLAUDE.md - Syla Platform

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Syla platform workspace.

## Getting Started

Always start your session by checking system health and workspace status:

```bash
./syla doctor && ./syla status
cat .eva/blackboard.md
```

## Workspace Structure

This is a **meta-platform workspace** that orchestrates multiple repositories:

```
syla/                          # Parent workspace (you are here)
â”œâ”€â”€ platforms/                 # Product platforms
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ syla/                 # Code execution platform
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ core/            # Core services
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ execution-service/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tools/           # Platform tools
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ .platform/                 # Meta-platform tooling
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ syla-cli/            # Workspace management CLI (Rust)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ repos.toml       # Repository manifest
â””â”€â”€ .eva/                     # Persistent AI memory
```

## Key Commands

### Workspace Management
```bash
./syla init              # Clone all repositories
./syla init -p syla      # Clone only Syla platform repos
./syla status            # Show repository and service status
./syla doctor            # Check system health
```

### Development
```bash
./syla dev up            # Start all services (not yet implemented)
./syla dev logs <service># View service logs (not yet implemented)
```

## Repository Naming Convention

- **Local directories**: No prefix (e.g., `cli`, `api-gateway`)
- **GitHub repositories**: With prefix (e.g., `syla-cli`, `syla-api-gateway`)
- **Full reference**: Platform.component (e.g., `syla.core.api-gateway`)

## Working with Services

Current services and their ports:
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8084
- **Execution Service**: http://localhost:8083
- **Redis**: localhost:6380
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5434

## Eva System

The `.eva/` directory contains persistent memory across sessions:
- `blackboard.md` - Current state and tasks
- `docs/` - Architecture documentation
- `projects/` - Project-specific workspaces

Key Eva commands:
```bash
# Check current context
cat .eva/blackboard.md

# Architecture docs
ls .eva/docs/architecture/
```

## Development Workflow

1. Check system: `./syla doctor`
2. Check status: `./syla status`  
3. Make changes in service directories
4. Test locally
5. Update blackboard
6. Commit changes in individual repos

## Important Notes

- This is a polyrepo architecture - each service is its own git repository
- The parent workspace will show child repos as untracked in git (this is expected)
- Always prefer Rust for new tooling and platform code
- Services communicate via gRPC (future) and REST (current)

## Current Implementation Status

- âœ… Meta-CLI (`syla`) with basic commands
- âœ… Repository manifest system
- âœ… API Gateway with REST endpoints
- âœ… Execution Service with Docker sandboxing
- âœ… CLI with local and remote execution
- ðŸš§ Platform orchestration commands
- ðŸš§ Unified development environment
- ðŸ“‹ Firecracker integration (planned)
- ðŸ“‹ Telemetry system (planned)
