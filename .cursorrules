# Syla Platform - Code Execution for Shipd

Building a high-performance code execution platform with:
- Firecracker microVMs for secure isolation
- Sub-100ms cold starts
- Polyrepo microservices in Rust
- gRPC communication
- Four workspace types: Ephemeral, Session, Persistent, Collaborative

## Eva System
Always use .eva/ for persistent memory:
- Read .eva/blackboard.md at start
- Update blackboard with progress
- Architecture in .eva/docs/architecture/

## Code Standards
- Rust with tokio/tonic/anyhow
- Database per service
- Health checks and metrics
- Comprehensive testing with testcontainers
